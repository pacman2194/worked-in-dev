          <h2>My Poor Eyes!</h2>
          <p>I am not a web developer. My buddy made fun of my site and said I couldn't share it with people the way it was. Naturally my response was to rip off some basic bootstrap and theme with bootswatch. Don't like it? Neither do I. Pray I don't alter it any further.</p>

          <h2>Contact</h2>
          <p>This is my personal website so anything on here is my opinion only and perhaps not an opinion you share. I hope we can respectfully disagree and maybe you'll share your thoughts with me if I ever get around to setting up that mailserver. Until then send it to /dev/null</p>

          <h2>Sarcastic Much?</h2>
          <p>Yes, I'm very sarcastic. Since this is not in any way a professional site, I wil not in any way act like a professional. I believe there is a time and place for that. But this isn't that time or place. Somewhere deep down in the midst of all the sarcasm there are fragments of information.</p>
