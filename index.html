          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>I am not a web developer. I'm slowly working on making this site look better but my primary focus isn't UI.
            The focus will be more on the infrastructure as code, experimenting with different tools and techniques, and
            sharing my ideas and experiences. This is my personal website so anything on here is my opinion. Your
            opinion may differ and I encourage skepticism, critical thinking, and criticism. We learn and improve from
            our mistakes or the mistakes of others. I hope we can respectfully disagree and maybe you'll share your
            thoughts with me. At this time I'm unsure the best way to allow people to contact me so I would recommend
            reaching out on <a style="text-decoration: underline;"
