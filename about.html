          you're here but I'm glad to have you, and I welcome you. Thanks for taking some time to visit my little corner
          of the internet. I wanted to build a site where I could practice some new skills. Skills like: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Infrastructure as Code</li>
          <li>Networking</li>
          <li>Configuring and managing servers</li>
          <li>Not webdev</li>
          <ul>
            <li>That's an unfortunate necessity of having a self-run website so hopefully you can forgive the
              appearance.</li>

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Drake and I am the owner and proprietor of this establishment. Kinda... What do we really own
            anymore? I suppose I can claim to own this as long as I keep paying the bills to Microsoft. Either way I'm
            very excited to have created this very small site to share some thoughts and experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned about the wonderful world of "DevOps" in 2018. I didn't really understand what the heck cloud
            computing even was until then. There seems to be a lack of preparation or information in college on the
            subject of career paths. Maybe that was just my college. Luckily I really enjoy learning in my free time.
            When I finally started to learn about it, I realized cloud computing is an amazing democratization of
            computing that enables large and small companies and individuals all to have access to the same resources.
            I've become fascinated with the power available to create and manage these resources on a whim. This is not
            only great for experimentation but also for starting up new companies. Process improvement is a new passion
            I've also developed since starting my career. I'll definitely be talking a little about that at some
            point.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy my time not working believe it or not. I've got a wonderful girlfriend and we have two dogs. We
            like to watch obscene amounts of television. Luckily I have good vision insurance. I also like to read
            comics and books. Yes... I like those picture books. If you haven't read any you should check out 'Bone'.
            It's an amazing epic story that I think anyone could enjoy. I obviously also like to take some time
            self-improving by practicing skills and reading articles related to my projects or potential new projects.
            My friends have also shown me the unfortunately wonderful world of GameBoy emulators and playing homebrewed
            games. I've also spent a ridiculous amount of time "distro hopping" Linux distros. I'm happy to say I've
            calmed down and that I run a couple different distros but I don't plan on changing them any time soon. If
            you're curious wehich ones I've chosen: Manjaro and Debian. I love Arch but Manjaro was just a bit easier to
            get my desktop going when dual-booting with Windows. Yes, I have Windows because inevitably I like playing
            games on it that I can't on Linux.

          <h2>What I have to share</h2>
          <p>
            I'm obviously inclined to share what I can about being part of an automation team for a cloud application
            suite. There's definitely going to be topics that are more universal such as process improvement, time and
            project management, and communication that I'd like to discuss. Other topics might be about implementing
            different architectures or tools into my work or personal projects. There's plenty of issues in a day I'm
            sure we could all talk about and this site is in part to take some time to talk about them.

            If you're still here then, truly, thank you. I hope you enjoy what I have to share. If you haven't realized
            yet I can be sarcastic from time to time or indulge way too far into making jokes. I will try my best to
            keep an appropriate level of information against the backdrop of really horrible humor I attempt to employ.

          <h2>Credits</h2>
          <p>
            I'd like to quickly mention some of what I am using to create this site because I think they are great
            projects and would like to promote interest in them if possible. I'm using <a
              style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to create and manage
            resources in <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft
              Azure</a>. HTTPS is made possible by <a style="text-decoration: underline;"
              href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline;"
              href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>. If you aren't familiar with these I definitely recommend
            taking a look. I've used Bootstrap and Bootswatch to create this site so it would be responsive and look
            decent.
